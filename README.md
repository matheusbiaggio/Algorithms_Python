## ðŸ“’ Introduction

In this project, I have implemented four key functions, accompanied by thorough unit tests to ensure their accuracy and functionality. Let's take a closer look at each of them:

  - <b>Anagram Checker</b>: This function checks whether two words are anagrams. It provides a valuable tool for linguistic analysis, wordplay enthusiasts, and can be used to identify similarities between words.

  - <b>Recursive Palindrome Checker</b>: Using recursion, this function determines if a word is a palindrome. It offers an efficient and elegant solution to this classic problem, enabling easy identification of words that read the same backward and forward.

  - <b>Occurrences in Lists</b>: This complex function verifies multiple lists and returns the count of occurrences of a given value within a specified range across those lists. It provides valuable insights into patterns and trends within the data, facilitating data analysis.

  - <b>Word Encryption</b>: This function encrypts a word, adding an extra layer of security to sensitive information. It can be utilized for various purposes, such as password protection or data encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of important data.

##  :wrench: Unit Tests
To ensure the reliability and functionality of each function, I have developed comprehensive unit tests. These tests cover various scenarios and edge cases, validating the accuracy of the implemented algorithms. They serve as a safeguard against potential bugs and allow for easy integration into larger projects.
